# About CNN file
## Intro
This file is used to build CNN model and conduct model training and prediction.
## How to use
The data in the Data file is divided into data sets. Please refer to the code in paper [1] for the division method. At the same time, please refer to the code in paper [1] for the code part of feature selection. After that, the data standardization file 0-1.py in CNN file is used to process the data. Run train.py code to train and test the model.
